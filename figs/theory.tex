One of the earliest cloud chamber photographs of a muon, taken in 1940~\cite{Williams1940102}.
In the left-most image the muon enters the chamber at point A and travels to point F, where it eventually decays to an electron which can be seen faintly leaving the image at point G.
The images to the right are a stereoscopic zoom in on point F, showing the relatively slow and more ionising muon and the faster, less ionising electron.

The setup of the first experiment to look for photons produced during muon decay taken from~\cite{Hincks194802}.
Cosmic muons arrived from the top, slowing down in the big block of lead, triggering two Geiger-Muller counters (A and B) as they passed and eventually coming to stop in the graphite.
From there, electrons and any potential photons would be detected in the counters above and below the graphite (B and C).  
No photons were seen in coincidence with an electron from muon decay, which lead theorists to hypothesise two distinct neutrino flavours.

The outgoing neutrinos produced in the \ac{SM} decay \protect\subref{fig:theory:feyn:muDecay} can be made into an internal neutrino propagator \protect\subref{fig:theory:feyn:muEGammaViaNu} via neutrino oscillations, whilst the addition of a photon ensures conservation the 4-momentum.
Although allowed in the \ac{SM} with neutrino oscillations, the actual rate from such a diagram is well below present experiment sensitivities.
A similar diagram was envisaged to show that the lack of observation of \mueg implied distinict neutrino flavours.

[The historic evolution of experimental upper limits on \ac{CLFV} in muon channels]{
The experimental limits on \ac{CLFV} in muon channels has been reduced by some 13 orders of magnitude since the first search in 1947.
Each improvement in the limit is primarily due to the increasing intensity of the muon source:
cosmic muons were used around 1950; accelerator-produced muons followed; surface muon sources further increased the intensity; and nowadays superconducting solenoids will capture and focus the resulting muon beam.
%The improvements in the limit are primarily linked to the intensity of the available muon source: around 1950 cosmic muons were used; accelerator-based muon sources improved this, 
The shaded grey region shows measurements that are currently under preparation.

[Comparison of \mueconv and \muegamma]{
Searches for \mueconv and \muegamma have relative sensitivities that depend on the underlying physics, making the two channels highly complementary.
As shown on the left, New Physics can produce a signal in both channels, but one channel or the other can be comparatively suppressed due to the need to include extra vertices and loops.
The plot on the right is adapted from~\cite{ProposalPhase1}, based on~\cite{DEGOUVEA2009303}, and shows the relative sensitivity for the toy lagrangian of equation~\eq{theory:toy} as a function of $\kappa$, how non-photonic the New Physics is, and $\Lambda$, the mass scale assuming coupling strengths of unity.
