For each target lengths 3e5 POT (30 runs of 1e4)
For each target radius 4.9e5 POT (49 runs of 1e4)

Beam input effects the yield:
 - For length scan shift beam input so plane is 1 cm before target front
 - For radius scan beam was fixed at default location (~ 24 cm before front surface)
 - Can expect proton beam to be tuneable to some degree, using dipoles and quads upstream

Momentum histograms used 12.5 MeV/c bin widths due to poor statistics

Normalisation factor = flux / 12.5 / POT * 1e3 => Flux per MeV/c per proton per mille
