\section{Muon Stopping Rate}
\begin{easylist}
# Profile in target
# Timing of muon stops
# 1.64e-3 per POT
# Asymmetry in X
# Y dependence due to momentum dispersion
# Scope for improvements, see appendix
# Effect of proton beam
# Hadron production model?
# Comparison of muon momenta: before collimator, around target, stopping in target, passing beam blocker
\end{easylist}

\section{Acceptance of Stopping Target Electrons}
\FigSensMomTransfer
\FigSensMomSpectra
\FigSensMomIntegral
\FigSensTiming
\begin{easylist}
# Geometric acceptance
## Flux plot and beamline height plot
# Momentum transfer matrix
# Momentum cut efficiency
## Spectrum after energy loss
## Spectrum after realistic resolution (TODO)
## Integrate downwards plot, with $S/\sqrt(S+B)$
# Timing cut
# Total signal acceptance
## This study vs. CDR
\end{easylist}

\section{Single Signal Event Sensitivity \acs{SES} and Run Time}
\begin{easylist}
# Equation
# Value of all parameters included in a table
## Stopping rate and signal acceptance are correlated via the target shaping and muon stopping distribution.
## That's accounted for here but raw scaling of these number should consider this
# Compare to previous prediction and Phase-II
# Plot of sensitivity vs. time ?
\end{easylist}
