The last study into the sensitivity of \COMET \phaseII was performed in 2009~\cite{CDRphase2}, before the staged approach and \phaseI design had even been considered.
That study found that a \ac{ses} of $2.6\times10^{-17}$ could be achieved in $2\times10^{7}$ seconds of running with a total expected background count rate of fewer than 0.34 events over the entire run period.
Since then, the focus of the collaboration has shifted to the \phaseI design and R\&D and the \phaseII design has not been optimisised or studied further.

The purpose of this chapter is to apply the updates in the fieldmap calculation, the geometry handling and physics modelling to revisit the design of \phaseII and demonstrate that it can do at least as well as the previous 2009 design.
Some aspects of the design have been fixed already by \phaseI such as the experiment hall and the coils and cold-mass of the first stages of the muon beamline.
The aspects of the experiment that remain open for optimisation are shown in \tab{optimisation:possible-parameters}.

\TabOptimisationParameters
As an initial configuration, much of the design from the 2009 study will be used, with updates included for the areas of the experiment that have since been refined by the \phaseI design.

\section{Optimisation Strategy}
%\begin{easylist}
%# Take some aspects as fixed
%# Limit scope and approach:
%## Ideally, each aspect optimised in combination to maximise signal acceptance and reduce background
%## How decoupled are each section?
%## In practise such an optimisation is not easy to do, instead aim to produce a baseline optimisation so that all backgrounds / issues can be identified
%## This can then form basis for further optimisation, with perhaps a smarter more integrated approach
%# Method:
%## Production target optimisation
%### Maximise muon and pion yield between 0 and 80 MeV at entrance to muon beamline
%### Parameters to vary: target length, target radius
%## Muon beam optimisation
%### Maximise muon stopping rate in stopping target
%### Minimise pion stopping rate
%### vary dipole along TS2 and TS4
%### vary Collimators: TS2 and at TS3
%## Electron spectrometer optimisation
%### Optimise dipole to increase signal acceptance
%### Optimse DIO blockers so DIO rate per straw is less than 1 kHz
%### Vary solenoidal field to increase separation?
%## Stopping target / beam blocker optimisation
%### Maximise reflection of signal electrons from upstream by tuning target position
%## Detector optimisation
%\end{easylist}

Some 32 parameters are listed in \tab{optimisation:possible-parameters} and yet this number alone does not describe the full challenge of optimising the \phaseII design since many of these parameters will be correlated.
It would seem natural for correlations to exist between the muon beam collimator(s), the stopping target and the beam blocker, since all involve removing or stopping muons and other particles in the beam.
Other less intuitive correlations might also exist however, and a complete optimisation would need to include the impact of these as well.

This optimisation study then can be considered a scan through a (greater than) 32 dimension parameter space.
A brute force search of such a space would be nightmarishly slow and require an enormous amount of computing power.
Machine learning algorithms or intelligent scanning techniques might be able to tackle such a problem, and perhaps in the future these methods will be used.
In the meantime however I am forced to use the technique of 'physicists intuition' to approach the problem, whereby some parameters are assumed uncorrelated whilst others are disregarded on the expectation that their impact be small.

The goal of this chapter therefore is not only to optimise the experiment but also to evaluate the correlations.
ideally this will also identify which parameters are the most strongly correlated, which would help make future optimisation studies more efficient.
The outputs of this optimisation should not be considered as final but should instead be treated as a baseline from which more intelligent approaches or physicists can improve.

%\section{Optimisation Goals}

%\end{easylist}

\section{Production Target Optimisation}
In the \phaseII \ac{CDR}, the production target is given as being 16~cm in
length and 4~mm in radius~\cite{CDR}.  Since then, there have been changes to
the magnetic field in this region, as well as the lengths and locations of
solenoids, shielding and beam-pipe, and the proton beam.  Previous studies have
looked at comparing the Tungsten target proposed for Phase-II to other
materials~\cite{thesis-AEdmonds}, and also drawn a comparison between
MARS~\cite{MARS}, Geant4~\cite{Geant4} and the limited data available.

The goal in this study then is to optimise the production target with the
up-to-date configurations.  This study aims to maximise the total muon and pion
yield below 80~MeV at the entrance to the Torus1 bent solenoid, by varying the
radius and length of the production target.

%\begin{easylist}
%# Some studies in the past (Andy's thesis) have compared Tungsten with Graphite and optimised Phase-I target
%# Geometry in CDR was 16~cm length and 4~mm radius
%# Proton beam, capture solenoids and radiation shielding has changed since then, so re-optimisation of the production target was needed
%\end{easylist}

%## The beam was fed in 1~cm upstream of target front face, which is the largest cause for errors in this optimisation study.
%end{easylist}

\Tab{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:configuration} gives the key parameters for the
beam input and other aspects of this simulation.  The location and orientation
of the target were held fixed, since the proton beamline is fixed with respect
to the muon beam axis.  Once a realistic proton beam becomes available, these
values would also benefit from optimisation, however.  During the scan over
length, the back face of the target was kept 8~cm away from the muon beam since
the radiation shielding has previously been optimised, and since beyond this
the magnetic field will no longer be able to capture the pions and muons
produced.

It must be noted that at this point in time there is an appreciable
uncertainty in the proton beam profile and position.  In particular, whilst the
proton beamline upstream has been delivered, the effect of the magnetic
field and necessary dipole and quadrupole magnetics are still being studied by
the proton beam-line group.  The beam profile is given in the \phaseI \ac{TDR}
as having a Gaussian profile and energy distribution, but no divergence or
location is given.  The effect of the proton beam distribution on the overall
sensitivity shall therefore be considered later on.

Protons originated from a plane (distributed as a two dimensional Gaussian
across this surface) but since there is therefore some scope to tune the proton
beam's position, the input particle plane was moved to remain 1~cm away from
the front surface of the target.  Since the aim is to maximise the muon and
pion yield by varying only the length and radius, shifting the proton beam
input plane in this way removes any variation of target acceptance due to
divergences of the proton beam in the magnetic field.

\subsection{Length Scan}
Different length targets were simulated with 3e5 POT per length.
Target length was varied in steps of 4~cm from 4 to 32~cm, whilst the target radius was held fixed at the CDR value of 4~mm.

\Fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Length:Momentum} shows the momentum distributions of pions and muons for different target lengths.
Target length is given as half-length which is the Geant4 convention.  
\Fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Length:Integral} then shows these distributions integrated up to different momentum.
From these plots it can be seen that for both muons and pions, the optimum target length occurs around a total length of 32~cm.

Additionally it can be seen from
\fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Length:IntegralRatio} that the shape of the
momentum distributions changes only weakly as a function of the target length.
These plots were produced by normalising the integrated momentum contours of
\fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Length:Integral} to the total integral below
400~MeV.  As a result, it is possible that the actual shape variation is even
weaker than apparent here, since in the present sample size, the high momentum
tail is not well sampled at small target lengths, such that a skew in the
normalisation might occur.

\FigOptimProdTgtLength

\subsection{Radius scan}
In parallel to the length optimisation scan, different radii targets were also simulated.
Targets with radii of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30~mm were tested.
The target length was held at the \ac{CDR} value of 16~cm in total.

The results of these scans can be seen in \fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Radius:Momentum} and \fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Radius:Integral},
where it can be seen that a maximum in both the muon and pion yields at the entrance to the Torus1 section is achieved at a radius of about 10~mm.
As in the length scan, the shape variation of the momentum distributions is rather weak as a function of target radius.

\FigOptimProdTgtRad

\subsection{Final Result}
Since the length and radius scan were performed in parallel, a final cross check was performed where the optimal radius was confirmed at the optimised target length.
The integrated spectrum is shown in \fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Combined:Integral} where it can be seen that the optimum radius once the target length is increased to 32~cm is still 10~mm.

The full 180\degree bent solenoid that makes up the bulk of the muon transport beam line is actually broken down into two
90\degree pieces -- Torus1 and Torus2 (also known as TS2 and TS4 by the magnet group).
Each of these sections has its own dipole field which need not provide the same dipole field strength.
The Torus1 section has been built already and was previously optimised for both \phaseI~\cite{TDR2016} and \phaseII~\cite{CDRphase2}. 
The dipole coils that it contains are designed to produce a dipole field of 0.055~T.
By running a lower current through these coils one could reduce the Torus1 dipole field without too much effort. 
However if \phaseII should require a greater dipole field strength for this region
that might be trickier since it could require additional windings to be inserted -- this would not be impossible but might costly.

\subsection{Large-sample Production Target Simulation}
Before the muon beam section could be optimised, a large set of \ac{POT} events were produced transporting all particles up to the entrance of the muon beam section.
In total, $2.4\times10^{8}$~POT were simulated through this stage, equivalent to about 1.4 bunches at \phaseII.
\CHECK{Are these numbers correct?}
The production target used the optimised geometry from the previous section.
All particles that hit the surface of the Torus1 container volume were read out for later re-use.
In addition, particles entering the proton beam dump were also saved if later simulations wished to study their impacts.

\subsection{The Optimised Dipole Field Strengths}
The figure-of-merit for this optimisation is the muon stopping rate, which will be maximised at the optimal field configuration.
%Toshiba have previously performed a realistic field calculation using OPERA for a single coil whose on-axis field has a mean of about 0.055~T.
To identify such a configuration, a 2D-grid scan was done where the Torus1 and Torus2 dipole fields were simultaneously varied.
Varying the field strength was done by applying a scale factor to the fieldmaps for each 90\degree section described in \sect{sw:fieldmap}.
These scale factors were varied in steps of 0.125 (equivalent to 6.875~mT) and for each point muons and pions from $8\times10^6$~POT were transported to the stopping target.
The stopping rate for each combination of scale factors was then assessed.

\FigOptimMuBeamDipoleMuStops
\FigOptimMuBeamDipolePiStops

The muon stopping rate as a function of the two dipole field strengths are shon in \fig{optim:muBeamDipole:stoppedMu}.
A scale factor of 1 on the x-axis means no change to the current \phaseI design and since there is little improvement by moving to larger values for Torus1 the optimal scale factors are chosen to be 1 and 0.5 for the Torus1 and TTorus2 respectively.  
This translates to dipole field strengths of 0.055 and 0.0275~T respectively.
\CHECK{Are these the final selected dipole field strengths?}

Also striking from \fig{optim:muBeamDipole:stoppedMu} is the anti-correlation between the two dipole field strengths.  
Roughly speaking the sum of the optimal dipole field values is constant, \ie $B_1^\text{optimal} + B_2^\text{optimal} = \text{const}$.
Although this was not previously foreseen, such a correlation can be understood accordingly.
The stopping target geometry and position is held fixed in this parameter scan, which essentially fixes the upper momentum of muons that can stop in the target.
%The initial momentum distribution grows roughly linearly with momentum for the momenta of muons that will stop in the target (see the later sections for more on this), which would suggest tuning to the higher momentum would increase the number of muons reaching the target.
%That effect however is greatly reduced by the fact that the initial muon beam has a very large transverse position profile
The drift of a particle due to the dipole field is proportional only to the distance travelled in that dipole field and the dipole field strength, and does not depend on the particle's momentum.
This means that the total drift due to the Torus1 and Torus2 dipole components is proportional to the weighted sum of the two dipole field strengths, where the weight is the distance travelled through each of the two sections.
Since each section is the same length, the time for a particle to pass through Torus1 will be roughly the same as the time in Torus2 so that the weights would be roughly equal.
This leads to the total drift being proportional to the sum of the two dipole fields.
Since the production target (as the source of muons) and stopping target (as the muons' destination) are at a fixed height with respect to one another the optimal vertical drift is also fixed so that the sum of the dipole field strengths should also be roughly fixed.

With that said, the Torus1 section has a higher pion flux which causes some assymetry between the two sections.
Keeping more pions on-axis in the Torus1 section means that more muons will enter the Torus2 section from those pions that have decayed.
But since the pion momentum distribution is slightly higher than the muon distribution keeping pions on axis requires a larger dipole field strength.
This could explain the slight assymetry where the muon stopping rate appears slightly larger if Torus1's field is larger than that of Torus2.

It is also interesting to consider the pion stopping rate as a function of the dipole field strengths.
However, as can been from \fig{optim:muBeamDipole:stoppedPi} the stopping rate is close to the level of POT events used in the simulation so that the plot is dominated by statistical fluctuations.

%\end{easylist}
The next element in the beamline after the muon transport solenoids will be the stopping target.
However, in order to study the impact of changing the stopping target parameters one will need to look at the impact on the signal acceptance into the detector.
To study that requires the components of the beamline intermediate to the target and the detector be optimised, namely the electron spectrometer.
The key free parameter in this section is the dipole field strength along the spectrometer.
The solenoidal field and solenoid aperture could also be optimised in principle, but these are considered beyond the scope of this study at this point and so the CDR values are held fixed here.
The point of this section is to establish the optimal dipole field strength given fixed target parameters which will then be studied separately together with the stability of the dipole field tune checked.

\subsection{Method and Potential Short-comings}
To study the effect of the dipole field on signal acceptance, a realistic muon stopping distribution in the target was produced by transporting muons from the production target simulation through to the stopping target.
Signal electrons were then injected at the target with the realistic stopping distribution and propagated through the beamline to the detector with different dipole field strengths.

A non-trivial short-coming of the current study is that the dipole field along the spectrometer is poorly modelled -- no realistic coil simulation exists, unlike for the bent muon transport beamlines.
As a result, a perfectly uniform dipole field is assumed with a sharp switch on and off at the entrance and exit of the spectrometer.
The impact that this has on the final result is not clear: one might expect it to be small given the relative strengths of the dipole and solenoidal fields and overall it is the integrated field that tends to matter.
However, the sharp switch-on of the field at the entrance and exit of the spectrometer is clearly not physical.
Given that the gradient introduced in the field by bending is present before the actual entrance and exit of the spectrometer (as a fringe field), some drift can be anticipated in this region.
A realistic dipole field with a realistic fringe field might overcome some of this drift however, so that the uniform field used here will most likely not capture this effect.
Nevertheless, given the absence of a realistic dipole field and scope of this study, the uniform one is the only real option at this point.

\subsection{Results}
\FigOptimESTDipoleBeamHeightTwoD
\FigOptimESTDipoleBeamHeightMean
\Fig{optim:ESTDipole:Beam} shows the projection of electron trajectories to the beam axis coordinate system for three different dipole field values.
The potency of this approach is clear from these plots; the tuneable dipole fields allow the momentum of electrons which remain on-axis to be accurately controlled (during run-time), which will benefit systematic and calibration studies that wish to study the \ac{DIO} spectrum at a lower energy.
\Fig{optim:ESTDipole:MeanHeight} then collects these plots with other dipole field strengths, plotting the mean height for all simulated electrons against the distance along the beam axis.
From this plot it can be seen how a dipole field of about 0.18~T appears optimal to keep the signal electrons on axis.

The probability for electrons to reach a given point in the beamline is shown in \fig{optim:ESTDipole:MeanFlux}, and indeed from this it can be seen that to maximize the probability of an electron reaching the detector
a dipole of around 0.18~T is desirable.
The behaviour of the low dipole field values (0 to 0.08~T) in this plot was not expected, but it is believed this is an artifact of the way this plot is made, coupled with a degree of mirroring at the entrance to the spectrometer which is enhanced as the dipole field strength increases.
If correct, a realistic dipole field calculation would be important to quantify and confirm this behaviour.
\FigOptimESTDipoleBeamFluxMean

\FigOptimESTDipoleAcceptanceVsDipole
Finally, to confirm the optimal dipole field strength the true geometric acceptance of the detector system is checked as a function of the dipole field strength, which is shown in \fig{optim:ESTDipole:acceptance}.
An electron is considered to have been geometrically accepted by the detector in this simulation if it produces at least one hit in the detector system.
In principle this could be in any straw plane, but in practice this is almost always in the first layer of straws.
Since this is a different way to analyze the acceptance compared to the survival probability it would not suffer to the artifact seen for low dipole field values in \fig{optim:ESTDipole:MeanFlux}.
Nonetheless, \fig{optim:ESTDipole:acceptance} confirms that the optimal dipole field strength is very close to 0.18~T.

A second important conclusion can be drawn from the fact that the dependence on the dipole field strength is relatively weak around the optimal value of 0.18~T.
A change of about 10\% in the dipole field strength only reduces the signal acceptance by about 3\% whilst a change of about 5\% would see a reduction of only about 0.7\%.


\section{Stopping Target Position}
%\begin{easylist}
%# Method
%	## Shift target position up or downstream by 50 cm 
%	## Muon stopping distribution with realistic beam sim. only include muons for speed
%	## Electron acceptance using realistic stopping distribution
%	## Don't change anything else about the target (size, length, number of disks, beam blocker distance, etc)
%	### Too many parameters, want only to achieve a complete baseline here.
%# Muon stopping rate vs, position
%# Electron acceptance times muon stopping rate = signal sensitivity vs. position
%# Stability of dipole field tune 
%# Impact on low energy electrons with regards to the subsequent DIO blocker tune stability
%# Impact of beam blocker on acceptance
%## See appendix for further discussion and further optimisation in this region
%\end{easylist}
The final aspect to be studied with regards to maximizing the signal sensitivity is the stopping target.
In principle there are many parameters related to the stopping target such as the location, disk shape (profile and thickness), and disk spacing
In addition the beam blocker should be considered in parallel with the stopping target since it sits so close to the target itself and can be expected to have a big impact on the signal acceptance.
However, this leaves far too many parameters to be considered all at once.

Since the field around the target tapers sharply various competing factors must be considered.
For example, prior to the stopping target region the muon beam is transported through a 3~T solenoidal field.
The magnetic field in the target region, however, tapers to about 1~T, which would cause the envelope of the muon beam to grow.
Moving the stopping target downstream would mean that the muon beam arrives with a larger aperture, and would therefore prefer a larger stopping target or else fewer muons will actually hit the target.
On the other hand, from the perspective of signal acceptance, the tapered field can be used to mirror signal electrons that are initially produced heading upstream therefore increasing the signal acceptance.
Moving the target further upstream then will reduce this effect as the difference between the magnetic field strengths at the exit of the bent muon transport solenoid and at the stopping target is reduced.

Given this and the need to reduce the number of parameters inspected, the target and beam blocker design was held fixed in this study and only the position was changed by moving the target upstream and downstream by $\pm50$~cm with respect to the nominal target location as given in the CDR~\cite{CDRphase2}.
Given that the target disks will occupy in total about 1~m, a shift of 50~cm corresponds to half the target length.
In each different position of the stopping target, as for the spectrometer dipole optimisation, a realistic stopping distribution was produced by running muons from the large-scale production target simulation through to the target.
This stopping distribution was then re-used to introduce signal electrons accordingly.
Additionally, low momentum electrons were also studied in order to study the impact of target position on the height of both signal and low-energy electrons as they pass through the spectrometer.
This is important both to check the correlation of the dipole field tune with the stopping target position, but also how the subsequent DIO blocker height optimisation will correlate the target position.
\FigOptimStopTgtPosMuStops

\Fig{optim:StopTgtPos:MuStops} shows how the rate of muon stops per \ac{POT} is affected by changing the position of the stopping target.
The relationship is roughly linear, dropping from around $2.2\times10{-3}$ muon stops per POT when the target is shifted upstream by 50~cm to about $1.3\times10^{-3}$ muon stops per POT if the target is shifted 50~cm in the other direction.
This relationship is as expected given the fixed radius of the target and the growth of the muon beam aperture arising from the reduction in the field strength.

\FigOptimStopTgtPosSensitivitySpect
In \fig{optim:StopTgtPos:AcceptedMomSpect} one can see the way the electron acceptance changes for different target positions.
Acceptance here is defined as producing at least one hit in the detector and the momentum shown is the momentum at the target, which is not necessarily the same as the momentum at which the electron is observed.
Each histogram in \fig{optim:StopTgtPos:AcceptedMomSpect} is normalised to the number of primary electrons introduced at the target per MeV/c and then scaled to the muon stopping rate.
This normalisation makes the value of each curve proportional to the sensitivity of the experiment to different momentum electrons, up to factors such as analysis cuts like timing and reconstruction quality.

\FigOptimStopTgtPosSensitivityIntegral
Since the parameter we wish to optimise here is the location of the stopping target, \fig{optim:StopTgtPos:AcceptIntegral:Adjacent} represents the same data as in \fig{optim:StopTgtPos:AcceptedMomSpect} but with each line representing the content of a different 5~MeV/c bin as a function of the target position.
For signal, it is the 105~MeV/c line (dark burgundy) that is most important and it can be seen that this is optimised for shifts upstream of the nominal position from between 10 and 20~cm.
It is also interesting to note that the acceptance of lower energy electrons is relatively decreased as the target is moved upstream, as can be seen in \fig{optim:StopTgtPos:AcceptIntegral:Ratio}.
This could be useful as a way to suppress hit rate from DIO electrons later.

Whilst we do not intend to optimise the beam blocker at this point, to check the impact that it has on the optimisation of the target position simulations were performed where the blocker was completely removed.
\Fig{optim:StopTgtPos:AcceptedMomSpectNoBeamBlock} shows the product of the stopping rate and electron acceptance when the blocker is removed.
From this the trend is much cleaner, electrons below 70~MeV/c are suppressed as you move the target upstream whereas the high energy electron acceptance increased.
\FigOptimStopTgtPosSensitivityNoBeamBlock


\FigOptimStopTgtPosHeights
Finally the relationship between the stopping target position and the mean height of electrons through the spectrometer is demonstrated in \fig{optim:StopTgtPos:Height}.
Each plot shows the mean heights for electrons with a given momentum for different stopping target positions and it is clear that there is some correlation between the mean height and the position of the stopping target.
For this reason, a more complete optimisation should consider optimising the two parameters simultaneously.
Nonetheless the change is not particularly large, only about a few cm difference by te end of the spectrometer for signal electrons.
This correlation is also likely related to the way the acceptance changes for different target positions when the beam blocker is removed.

The second striking feature from the plots in \fig{optim:StopTgtPos:Height} is the way the mean height aquires a strong sinusoidal component for large target shifts upstream.
This suggests that when the target is shifted upstream the electrons passing the entrance to the spectrometer tend to have a particular value for the pitch and phase angles of the trajectories.
Several separate mechanisms could produce this effect.
Firstly the acceptance around the target itself could aquire a stronger preference for certain pitch and phase angles when the target is moved upstream.
Secondly, since the stopping target disks will see more of the muon beam upstream, the muon stopping distribution could become less homogenous.  Whilst electrons are produced isotropically path with less target material along them will tend to accept outgoing electrons more readily such that if more muons stop at one side of the target than the other a dependence on pitch and phase could arise.

Clearly then the stopping target region is a very complicated area; even though this study has focussed on a single parameter -- the position of the target itself -- it is clear that this correlates to many other variables.
This is a region in the experiment most ripe for further optimisation then, and indeed appendix~\ref{sec:appendix:stopTgtImprove} shows some of the first steps that have made in this direction since the optimisation described here was completed.
Unfortunately, at the time this work was carried out an error in the normalisation of these plots lead to the conclusion that the optimal shift was between 0 and 10~cm upstream.
Given the complexity of the optimisation in this region, it was therefore decided to keep the stopping target at the nominal location for the subsequent steps.
Having corrected the normalisation of the plots, the conclusion now is that the optimal location is between 10 and 20~cm upstream, so perhaps the target should have been shifted back.
However the improvement to the sensitivity would have been small: shifting the target back about 20~cm improves the sensitivity by around 2\% compared to the signal acceptance at nominal position.
%Given this small improvement and the complexity of this region it was decided that the stopping target was kept to the nominal position.

With the beam line optimised for high signal efficiency, one can look at improving the background by adding collimators into the muon beam line to reduce the flux of high-momentum muons and pions.

\Fig{optim:MuBeamDipole:MuDispersion} shows the dispersive effect of the bent solenoid and dipole field on muons passing through the beamline.
Thanks to this dispersion low momentum muons that can stop in the target and high momentum muons which could produce backgrounds are separated sufficiently so that material in the beam pipe can selectively remove the dangerous, high-momentum muons with only a small impact on the muon stopping rate.

\subsection{Collimator Placement}
\FigOptimMuBeamCollimMuonPaths
The plots in \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline} give a sense of where best to locate the collimating material.
In \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline:All} the paths of all muons along the beamline is shown.
\Fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline:Stopped} then separates out the muons that stop in the target which should be compared to 
\fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline:HighP} showing the paths of muons that reach the stopping target region with momentum greater than 70~MeV/c (the threshold for a muon to decay to an electron with $p>100$~MeV/c).

It is interesting to note the apparent asymmetry in the high-momentum muons at the entrance to the Torus1 that can be seen in \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline:HighP}.  
This is not because of some momentum-dependence in the acceptance of the preceding beamline, but due to the fact that muons in that plot are only included if they are `dangerous' in the region around the stopping target.
Even without additional collimators, the beam pipe itself removes high momentum muons that enter in the lower half of the beamline.
The validity of only tagging high momentum muons around the stopping target region comes from the assumption that the products of high-momentum muons that decay before this region can be reliably removed.
It is important then that this assumption be checked, but for this work this is left as a task for the future.

Finally then in \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline:Diff} the difference between the high-momentum muons and the paths of those that stop is shown. 
Regions in blue on this plot show where many more high-momentum muons pass than stopping muons; it is in these locations that collimator material will be most effective.
This approach could also be improved, since taking the straight difference between the two plots implies equal weighting for stopping muons and high-momentum ones.
In reality, whilst a muon tagged as stopping is definitely going to stop, a high-momentum muon should be weighted by the probability to produce a signal-like electron and the probability that this electron survives to be accepted into the detector, passing all analysis cuts.
This would make the weighting for the high-momentum muons be a function of the beamline distance itself which again requires a study into how high-momentum electrons are accepted.
However for the purposes of obtaining a qualitative sense of where to collimate the unweighted difference should be sufficient.

Two regions of interest appear: in the upper half of the entrance to Torus1 and the lower half of the exit of Torus2.  
Collimating at the Torus1 entrance is justified by the basis that high momentum muons will tend to have larger gyroradii compared to the muons that stop, and that at this point the beam is largely on-axis and has not yet been dispersed.
Collimating at the exit of Torus2 is readily understood on the grounds that the high momentum muons will have all drifted downwards by this point, compared to the low momentum stopping muons which are kept on-axis by the dipole fields.

\FigOptimMuBeamCollimTransverseSep
These conclusions are backed by the plots shown in \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:TransverseSep} which show transverse slices through the beamline at the entrance to Torus1 (0\degree of bent solenoid), the midpoint between Torus1 and Torus2 (after 90\degree of bent solenoid) and at the exit of Torus2 (after 180\degree).
From these plots one can also see how in the middle of the bent solenoids (at 90\degree) the separation between muons that will stop and those that will have momentum greater than or equal to 70~MeV/c in the stopping target region is weakest, and hence collimators in this location will not be so effective.

\subsection{Collimator Height Optimisation}
\FigOptimMuBeamCollimTorusOne
To identify the optimum height for the collimators in a computationally efficient way, events were generated without any collimators included.
The full three dimensional trajectory of all particles as well as the decay tree were persisted.
This allows for a `virtual' collimator to be used, where particles that enter a defined region and their secondaries are removed from the downstream plots.
Whilst this method allows for many collimator shapes and heights to be tested quickly, it comes with a couple of limitations.
Firstly, the accuracy depends on the trajectory sampling density, which should be fine but this results in large data sizes.
Secondly, realistic material effects of the collimator cannot be captured, such as the probability a particle is simply scattered rather than stopping completely, or the result of secondary particles produced in the collimator itself.
\FigOptimMuBeamCollimTorusTwoFraction
\FigOptimMuBeamCollimTorusTwoContours
\FigOptimMuBeamCollimMuonPathsWColl

\Fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Torus1} shows the results of lowering the bottom edge of the collimator material in Torus1.
\Fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Torus1:perPOT} shows the probability per \ac{POT} that different types of particle (stopped muons and high momentum muons, pions, and electrons) pass the collimator as a function of the collimator height.
On the other hand, \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Torus1:fraction} shows the same plots but normalised to the total number of each particle type that reaches the collimator in the first place, therefore showing the survival probability along just the collimator region.
Based on these plots, for a collimator that starts at 120~mm above the beamline axis, 14\% of high momentum pions are removed, high momentum muons are suppressed by 14\% whilst the muon stopping rate is reduced only by 3\%.

For the second collimator at the exit to Torus2, the situation is slightly more complicated since in principle the optimum height could be correlated to the height of the upstream Torus1 collimator.
To account for this, the virtual collimator technique was applied for both the Torus1 and Torus2 collimator sections simultaneously.
As a result, the 1-dimensional plots of \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Torus1} become 2D as can be seen in 
%\fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Torus2:perPOT}, which is normalised to the rate per POT, and 
\fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Torus2:fraction}, which is normalised to the particle flux just before the collimator similar to \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Torus1:fraction}.
%\FigOptimMuBeamCollimTorusTwoPerPOT

\Fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Torus2:contours} represents the stopping and high-momentum plots in a way that is easier to compare the two directly.
Each line in that plot is a contour showing a change of 2.5 percentage points to the yield.  Total acceptance, or 100\% is in the bottom right corner.
From this plot it can be seen that whilst keeping more than 97.5\% of the muon stopping rate (the bottom-right most blue contour), the maximum high momentum muon suppression is achieved when the Torus1 collimator sits about 140~mm above the beam axis, and the Torus2 collimator sits about 120~mm below it.
To be precise, at these collimator values  the muon stopping rate is kept at 99\% of the no-collimator rate, whilst high momentum pions, muons and electrons drop to 27.6\%, 20.9\% and 11\% (although this last value is very statistically limited) respectively, compared to their no-collimator rates.
At this point the selected values for the collimator heights give conservative background suppressions and tighter values could be chosen.
Given that backgrounds from high-momentum muons are suppressed compared to the actual rate of `dangerous' muons by the geometric acceptance of the remaining beamline and the timing and momentum cuts this seems reasonable at this stage although this will of course be investigated in the next chapter.

Finally, for comparison to the original plots, \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:BeamWColl} shows the impact the new collimators have on the muon components of the beam.
It is clear how greatly reduced the number of muons passing the stopping target region has now become.
