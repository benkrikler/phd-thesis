The last study into the sensitivity of \COMET \phaseII was performed in 2009~\cite{CDRphase2}, before the staged approach and \phaseI design had even been considered.
That study found that a \ac{ses} of $2.6\times10^{-17}$ could be achieved in $2\times10^{7}$ seconds of running with a total expected background count rate of fewer than 0.34 events over the entire run period.
Since then, the focus of the collaboration has shifted to the \phaseI design and R\&D and the \phaseII design has not been optimisised or studied further.

The purpose of this chapter is to apply the updates in the fieldmap calculation, the geometry handling and physics modelling to revisit the design of \phaseII and demonstrate that it can do at least as well as the previous 2009 design.
Some aspects of the design have been fixed already by \phaseI such as the experiment hall and the coils and cold-mass of the first stages of the muon beamline.
The aspects of the experiment that remain open for optimisation are shown in \tab{optimisation:possible-parameters}.

\TabOptimisationParameters
As an initial configuration, much of the design from the 2009 study will be used, with updates included for the areas of the experiment that have since been refined by the \phaseI design.

\section{Optimisation Strategy}
%\begin{easylist}
%# Take some aspects as fixed
%# Limit scope and approach:
%## Ideally, each aspect optimised in combination to maximise signal acceptance and reduce background
%## How decoupled are each section?
%## In practise such an optimisation is not easy to do, instead aim to produce a baseline optimisation so that all backgrounds / issues can be identified
%## This can then form basis for further optimisation, with perhaps a smarter more integrated approach
%# Method:
%## Production target optimisation
%### Maximise muon and pion yield between 0 and 80 MeV at entrance to muon beamline
%### Parameters to vary: target length, target radius
%## Muon beam optimisation
%### Maximise muon stopping rate in stopping target
%### Minimise pion stopping rate
%### vary dipole along TS2 and TS4
%### vary Collimators: TS2 and at TS3
%## Electron spectrometer optimisation
%### Optimise dipole to increase signal acceptance
%### Optimse DIO blockers so DIO rate per straw is less than 1 kHz
%### Vary solenoidal field to increase separation?
%## Stopping target / beam blocker optimisation
%### Maximise reflection of signal electrons from upstream by tuning target position
%## Detector optimisation
%\end{easylist}

Some 32 parameters are listed in \tab{optimisation:possible-parameters} and yet this number alone does not describe the full challenge of optimising the \phaseII design since many of these parameters will be correlated.
It would seem natural for correlations to exist between the muon beam collimator(s), the stopping target and the beam blocker, since all involve removing or stopping muons and other particles in the beam.
Other less intuitive correlations might also exist however, and a complete optimisation would need to include the impact of these as well.

This optimisation study then can be considered a scan through a (greater than) 32 dimension parameter space.
A brute force search of such a space would be nightmarishly slow and require an enormous amount of computing power.
Machine learning algorithms or intelligent scanning techniques might be able to tackle such a problem, and perhaps in the future these methods will be used.
In the meantime however I am forced to use the technique of 'physicists intuition' to approach the problem, whereby some parameters are assumed uncorrelated whilst others are disregarded on the expectation that their impact be small.

The goal of this chapter therefore is not only to optimise the experiment but also to evaluate the correlations.
ideally this will also identify which parameters are the most strongly correlated, which would help make future optimisation studies more efficient.
The outputs of this optimisation should not be considered as final but should instead be treated as a baseline from which more intelligent approaches or physicists can improve.

%\section{Optimisation Goals}
%\begin{easylist}
%# Set sensitivity goal and optimise to reach this
%# Identify which parameters are strongly correlated to help focus and improve the efficiency of future optimisation studies.
%# Single event sensitivity only considers signal acceptance, but also need to understand backgrounds in terms of final confidence limit that can be set
%\end{easylist}

\section{Production Target Optimisation}
In the \phaseII \ac{CDR}, the production target is given as being 16~cm in
length and 4~mm in radius~\cite{CDR}.  Since then, there have been changes to
the magnetic field in this region, as well as the lengths and locations of
solenoids, shielding and beam-pipe, and the proton beam.  Previous studies have
looked at comparing the Tungsten target proposed for Phase-II to other
materials~\cite{thesis-AEdmonds}, and also drawn a comparison between
MARS~\cite{MARS}, Geant4~\cite{Geant4} and the limited data available.

The goal in this study then is to optimise the production target with the
up-to-date configurations.  This study aims to maximise the total muon and pion
yield below 80~MeV at the entrance to the Torus1 bent solenoid, by varying the
radius and length of the production target.

%\begin{easylist}
%# Some studies in the past (Andy's thesis) have compared Tungsten with Graphite and optimised Phase-I target
%# Geometry in CDR was 16~cm length and 4~mm radius
%# Proton beam, capture solenoids and radiation shielding has changed since then, so re-optimisation of the production target was needed
%\end{easylist}

%## Back of target fixed 8~cm behind nominal centre (intersection of Proton beam axis and muon beam-line axis)

%# Use proton beam parameters from TDR2014:
%## Double Gaussian with horizontal spread of 5.8 mm and vertical spread of 2.9 mm.
%## Energy distribution also Gaussian with mean kinetic energy 8.01 GeV and 0.135~MeV spread in sigma.
%## The beam was fed in 1~cm upstream of target front face, which is the largest cause for errors in this optimisation study.
%end{easylist}

\Tab{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:configuration} gives the key parameters for the
beam input and other aspects of this simulation.  The location and orientation
of the target were held fixed, since the proton beamline is fixed with respect
to the muon beam axis.  Once a realistic proton beam becomes available, these
values would also benefit from optimisation, however.  During the scan over
length, the back face of the target was kept 8~cm away from the muon beam since
the radiation shielding has previously been optimised, and since beyond this
the magnetic field will no longer be able to capture the pions and muons
produced.

It must be noted that at this point in time there is an appreciable
uncertainty in the proton beam profile and position.  In particular, whilst the
proton beamline upstream has been delivered, the effect of the magnetic
field and necessary dipole and quadrupole magnetics are still being studied by
the proton beam-line group.  The beam profile is given in the \phaseI \ac{TDR}
as having a Gaussian profile and energy distribution, but no divergence or
location is given.  The effect of the proton beam distribution on the overall
sensitivity shall therefore be considered later on.

Protons originated from a plane (distributed as a two dimensional Gaussian
across this surface) but since there is therefore some scope to tune the proton
beam's position, the input particle plane was moved to remain 1~cm away from
the front surface of the target.  Since the aim is to maximise the muon and
pion yield by varying only the length and radius, shifting the proton beam
input plane in this way removes any variation of target acceptance due to
divergences of the proton beam in the magnetic field.

\subsection{Length Scan}
Different length targets were simulated with 3e5 POT per length.
Target length was varied in steps of 4~cm from 4 to 32~cm, whilst the target radius was held fixed at the CDR value of 4~mm.

\Fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Length:Momentum} shows the momentum distributions of pions and muons for different target lengths.
Target length is given as half-length which is the Geant4 convention.  
\Fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Length:Integral} then shows these distributions integrated up to different momentum.
From these plots it can be seen that for both muons and pions, the optimum target length occurs around a total length of 32~cm.

Additionally it can be seen from
\fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Length:IntegralRatio} that the shape of the
momentum distributions changes only weakly as a function of the target length.
These plots were produced by normalising the integrated momentum contours of
\fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Length:Integral} to the total integral below
400~MeV.  As a result, it is possible that the actual shape variation is even
weaker than apparent here, since in the present sample size, the high momentum
tail is not well sampled at small target lengths, such that a skew in the
normalisation might occur.

\FigOptimProdTgtLength

\subsection{Radius scan}
In parallel to the length optimisation scan, different radii targets were also simulated.
Targets with radii of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30~mm were tested.
The target length was held at the \ac{CDR} value of 16~cm in total.

The results of these scans can be seen in \fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Radius:Momentum} and \fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Radius:Integral},
where it can be seen that a maximum in both the muon and pion yields at the entrance to the Torus1 section is achieved at a radius of about 10~mm.
As in the length scan, the shape variation of the momentum distributions is rather weak as a function of target radius.

\FigOptimProdTgtRad

\subsection{Final Result}
Since the length and radius scan were performed in parallel, a final cross check was performed where the optimal radius was confirmed at the optimised target length.
The integrated spectrum is shown in \fig{optimisation:ProdTgtSec:Combined:Integral} where it can be seen that the optimum radius once the target length is increased to 32~cm is still 10~mm.

The full 180\degree bent solenoid that makes up the bulk of the muon transport beam line is actually broken down into two
90\degree pieces -- Torus1 and Torus2 (also known as TS2 and TS4 by the magnet group).
Each of these sections has its own dipole field which need not provide the same dipole field strength.
The Torus1 section has been built already and was previously optimised for both \phaseI~\cite{TDR2016} and \phaseII~\cite{CDRphase2}. 
The dipole coils that it contains are designed to produce a dipole field of 0.055~T.
By running a lower current through these coils one could reduce the Torus1 dipole field without too much effort. 
However if \phaseII should require a greater dipole field strength for this region
that might be trickier since it could require additional windings to be inserted -- this would not be impossible but might costly.

\subsection{Large-sample Production Target Simulation}
Before the muon beam section could be optimised, a large set of \ac{POT} events were produced transporting all particles up to the entrance of the muon beam section.
In total, $2.4\times10^{8}$~POT were simulated through this stage, equivalent to about 1.4 bunches at \phaseII.
\CHECK{Are these numbers correct?}
The production target used the optimised geometry from the previous section.
All particles that hit the surface of the Torus1 container volume were read out for later re-use.
In addition, particles entering the proton beam dump were also saved if later simulations wished to study their impacts.

\subsection{The Optimised Dipole Field Strengths}
The figure-of-merit for this optimisation is the muon stopping rate, which will be maximised at the optimal field configuration.
%Toshiba have previously performed a realistic field calculation using OPERA for a single coil whose on-axis field has a mean of about 0.055~T.
To identify such a configuration, a 2D-grid scan was done where the Torus1 and Torus2 dipole fields were simultaneously varied.
Varying the field strength was done by applying a scale factor to the fieldmaps for each 90\degree section described in \sect{sw:fieldmap}.
These scale factors were varied in steps of 0.125 (equivalent to 6.875~mT) and for each point muons and pions from $8\times10^6$~POT were transported to the stopping target.
The stopping rate for each combination of scale factors was then assessed.

\FigOptimMuBeamDipoleMuStops
\FigOptimMuBeamDipolePiStops

The muon stopping rate as a function of the two dipole field strengths are shon in \fig{optim:muBeamDipole:stoppedMu}.
A scale factor of 1 on the x-axis means no change to the current \phaseI design and since there is little improvement by moving to larger values for Torus1 the optimal scale factors are chosen to be 1 and 0.5 for the Torus1 and TTorus2 respectively.  
This translates to dipole field strengths of 0.055 and 0.0275~T respectively.
\CHECK{Are these the final selected dipole field strengths?}

Also striking from \fig{optim:muBeamDipole:stoppedMu} is the anti-correlation between the two dipole field strengths.  
Roughly speaking the sum of the optimal dipole field values is constant, \ie $B_1^\text{optimal} + B_2^\text{optimal} = \text{const}$.
Although this was not previously foreseen, such a correlation can be understood accordingly.
The stopping target geometry and position is held fixed in this parameter scan, which essentially fixes the upper momentum of muons that can stop in the target.
%The initial momentum distribution grows roughly linearly with momentum for the momenta of muons that will stop in the target (see the later sections for more on this), which would suggest tuning to the higher momentum would increase the number of muons reaching the target.
%That effect however is greatly reduced by the fact that the initial muon beam has a very large transverse position profile
The drift of a particle due to the dipole field is proportional only to the distance travelled in that dipole field and the dipole field strength, and does not depend on the particle's momentum.
This means that the total drift due to the Torus1 and Torus2 dipole components is proportional to the weighted sum of the two dipole field strengths, where the weight is the distance travelled through each of the two sections.
Since each section is the same length, the time for a particle to pass through Torus1 will be roughly the same as the time in Torus2 so that the weights would be roughly equal.
This leads to the total drift being proportional to the sum of the two dipole fields.
Since the production target (as the source of muons) and stopping target (as the muons' destination) are at a fixed height with respect to one another the optimal vertical drift is also fixed so that the sum of the dipole field strengths should also be roughly fixed.

With that said, the Torus1 section has a higher pion flux which causes some assymetry between the two sections.
Keeping more pions on-axis in the Torus1 section means that more muons will enter the Torus2 section from those pions that have decayed.
But since the pion momentum distribution is slightly higher than the muon distribution keeping pions on axis requires a larger dipole field strength.
This could explain the slight assymetry where the muon stopping rate appears slightly larger if Torus1's field is larger than that of Torus2.

It is also interesting to consider the pion stopping rate as a function of the dipole field strengths.
However, as can been from \fig{optim:muBeamDipole:stoppedPi} the stopping rate is close to the level of POT events used in the simulation so that the plot is dominated by statistical fluctuations.

\section{Collimators in the Muon Beamline}

%	## Beamline projection for stopped and high-P muons
%	## Subtraction of the good and bad muons to suggest the region of interest for collimators

%	### Cannot study secondary particles
%	### Assumes all particles entering the collimators are killed
%	## Current collimator from Phase-I are in a different location to those suggested here
%# Results of study, recommended collimator design
%\end{easylist}
\FigOptimMuBeamDipoleMuDispersion
\Fig{optim:MuBeamDipole:MuDispersion} shows the dispersive effect of the bent solenoid and dipole field on muons passing through the beamline.
Thanks to this dispersion low momentum muons that can stop in the target and high momentum muons which could produce backgrounds are separated sufficiently so that material in the beam pipe and selectively remove the dangerous, high-momentum muons with only a small impact on the muon stopping rate.

\subsection{Collimator Placement}
\FigOptimMuBeamCollimMuonPaths
The plots in \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline} give a sense of where best to locate the collimating material.
In \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline:All} the paths of all muons along the beamline is shown.
\Fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline:Stopped} then separates out the muons that stop in the target which should be compared to 
\fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline:HighP} which shows the paths of muons that reach the stopping target region with momentum greater than 70~MeV/c (the threshold for a muon to decay to an electron with $p>100$~MeV/c).

It is interesting to note the apparent asymmetry in the high-momentum muons at the entrance to the Torus1 that can be seen in \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline:HighP}.  
This is not because of some momentum-dependence in the acceptance of the preceding beamline, but due to the fact that muons in that plot are only included if they are `dangerous' in the region around the stopping target region.
Even without additional collimators, the beam pipe itself removes high momentum muons that enter in the lower half of the beamline.
The validity of only tagging high momentum muons around the stopping target region comes from the assumption that the products of high-momentum muons that decay before this region can be reliably removed.
It is important then that this assumption be checked, but at this stage checking this shall be left as a task for the future.

Finally then in \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:Beamline:Diff} the difference between the high-momentum muons and the paths of those that stop is shown. 
Regions in blue on this plot show where many more high-momentum muons pass than stopping muons; it is in these locations that collimator material will be most effective.
This approach could also be improved, since taking the straight difference between the two plots implies equal weighting for stopping muons and high-momentum ones.
In reality, whilst a muon tagged as stopping is definitely going to stop, a high-momentum muon should be weighted by the probability to produce a signal-like electron which is then accepted by the beamline.
That means the weighting for the high-momentum muons should actually be a function of the beamline distance itself which again requires a study into how high-momentum electrons are accepted.
However for the purposes of obtaining a qualitative sense of where to collimate the unweighted difference should be sufficient.

The two regions of interest then are in the upper half of the entrance to Torus1 and the lower half of the exit of Torus2.  
Collimating at the Torus1 entrance is justified by the basis that high momentum muons will tend to have larger gyroradii compared to the muons that stop and at that point the beam is largely on-axis and has not yet been dispersed.
Collimating at the exit of Torus2 is readily understood on the grounds that the high momentum muons will have all drifted downwards by this point, compared to the low momentum stopping muons.

\FigOptimMuBeamCollimTransverseSep
These conclusions are backed by the plots shown in \fig{optim:MuBeamCollim:TransverseSep} which show transverse slices through the beamline at the entrance to Torus1 (0\degree of bent solenoid), the midpoint between Torus1 and Torus2 (after 90\degree of bent solenoid) and at the exit of Torus2 (after 180\degree).
Again it is clear that in the middle of the solenoid the separation between muons that will stop and those that will have momentum greater than or equal to 70~MeV/c in the stopping target region is weakest.
