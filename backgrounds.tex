\chapter{\phaseII Backgrounds}
Having optimised and evaluated the signal sensitivity, it is now important to check the expected background rates.
Interpreting the final result to declaring an observation or produce a confidence limit is only possible if the number of background events has been predicted.
The certainty of any observation or the stringency of a final confidence limit is determined by the relative background rate and signal sensitivity; ideally the background rate should be small, well below a single expected event.

The types of background we must consider for COMET were outlined in \sect{detector:background}, but in this section they are evaluated in the optimised experiment design using the improved simulation.

\FigDIOBackground
\section{Muon Decay in Orbit (\acs{DIO})}
\sectlabel{bg:dio}
%\begin{easylist}
%# Discussed in previous section \sect{sense:momentum}
%# DIO spectrum near end-point: which expansion is correct?
%# Final DIO rate above momentum threshold with resolution
%\end{easylist}
In order to decide the optimal threshold for the momentum cut, it was necessary, in section \sect{sense:momentum}, to study the rate of \ac{DIO} events.
At the selected momentum threshold of \VarMomThreshold, the number of expected DIO events per muon stop is \VarDIOPerMuStop{}.
Given the \VarTotalMuStops~muon stops that should take place during \phaseII, the total expected number of background events due to DIO is \VarDIOTotal.

However, it is important to note just how steeply falling the DIO rate is in this region.
\Fig{bg:dio:rates} shows how, given a fixed signal sensitivity, the number of DIO background events is affected.
Changing the momentum threshold also affects the signal acceptance, so that for a fixed \ac{ses} one must increase the running time.
Simultaneously, with more muons stopped the \ac{DIO} rate will increase for a fixed momentum threshold.
\Fig{bg:dio:rates} was produced using the same DIO and signal spectra shown in \fig{sense:spectra:resolution}, which included energy losses in the material of the target, beamline, and detector, as well as a 200~keV/c Gaussian resolution function. 
In addition, all the acceptance parameters of the sensitivity chapter were held fixed, except for the momentum cut efficiency.

\FigDIOEndPointComparison
The fact that the run-time, signal acceptance, and background rate depend so strongly on the momentum threshold makes the theoretical prediction for the \ac{DIO} spectrum particularly important.
The two most recent calculations of the high energy tail of the DIO spectrum are shown in \fig{bg:dio:spectra}, as well as the cruder function that fits the whole spectrum range, used in SimG4.
The more conservative spectrum from the 2011 paper has been used in this study.
However, if one were to use the more recent 2015 spectrum, background rates due to DIO would fall to 0.072 events at the same momentum threshold.
This would agree with that papers statement that the inclusion of radiative corrections suppresses the DIO background by 15\% at the end-point.

In total, based on the 2011 DIO spectrum, \sci{14}{-17} electrons would be produced per muon stop with momentum greater than 104~MeV/c.
Therefore, the DIO rejection efficiency, including both geometric effects and the threshold on the detected momentum, suppress the detection of DIO end-point electrons by about 98.4\%.

\section{Radiative Muon Capture (\acs{RMC})}
\TabRMCEndPoints%
\sectlabel{bg:rmc}
During the process of nuclear muon capture, there is a finite probability of a hard photon being radiated from the muon, nucleus, or the exchanged $W$-boson.
This is known as \acf{RMC} and is distinguished from radioactive gamma-ray production during nuclear de-excitation or decay of the daughter nucleus.
The maximum energy this photon can take, $\max(E_e^\textrm{RMC})$, differs from the \mueconv signal and \ac{DIO} end-point by the minimum energy needed to change the nucleus from $N(A,Z)$ to $N(A,Z-1)$:
\begin{align}
\max(E_e^\textrm{RMC})=&\big(M_\mu - B_{\mu,\textrm{binding}} - E_\textrm{rec}\big)-\big(M_{N_2}+\sum_iM_{h_i}-M_{N_1}-\Delta{}Z\cdot{}M_e\big),\\
                      =&E^\textrm{Conversion}_e  - \Delta{}M,
\end{align}
with $M_{N_1}$ and $M_{N_2}$ the mass of the parent and daughter nuclei respectively, and $M_{h_i}$ the mass of the $i$-th hadron (proton, neutron, alpha, \etc).
The mass of the electron, $M_e$, must also be included since for ever proton removed from the nucleus, given by $\Delta{}Z$, a free electron must be ejected from the atomic orbitals.
$\Delta{}M$ is then the total energy lost to changes in the atomic mass%
\footnote{
One has to think of the atomic mass difference, rather than the nuclear mass difference.
The distinction is important since consideration of the nuclear masses alone would ignore the effect on the atomic electrons.
Under nuclear muon capture (radiative or otherwise), the number of protons in the nucleus is reduced by at least one, and accordingly atomic electrons become unbound.
The notation here follows that of the COMET TDR~\cite{TDR2016} and CDR~\cite{CDRphase2}, where the electron mass is absorbed into the value of $\Delta{}M$ (although there it is called $\Delta_{Z-1}$).
}
of the nuclei and other emitted hadrons.

When an aluminium-27 nucleus captures a muon various daughter nuclei are possible.
If no other particles are emitted, as part of a prompt process or direct nucleon capture, the daughter nucleus will be magnesium-27.
In general, this could be left in an excited state, but to reach the end-point of the \ac{RMC} spectrum it will be left in the ground-state configuration.
The atomic mass difference between these two nuclei is shown in \tab{bg:rmc:massDifferences}, where it can be seen the RMC end-point is separated from the \mueconv signal energy by around 3~MeV.

\FigRMCExperiments
%\newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{\cdot}{#1} }

\Fig{bg:rmc:experiments} shows the summary table of experimental data on Aluminium, taken from the summary by Gorringe~\cite{RevModPhys.76.31}.
It is interesting to note that in all experiments to date none of the emprical fits to RMC used have suggested an end-point above 90.1~MeV~\cite{PhysRevC.37.1633,PhysRevC.46.1094,PhysRevC.59.2853}.
This is close to the end-point predicted by the various transitions besides ${}^{27}$Al$(\mu,\gamma\nu){}^{27}$Mg.
The most recent of these two experiments both measure the branching ratio for \ac{RMC} producing photons with $E>57~$MeV to ordinary muon capture to be \sci{1.43}{-5}. 

To produce a background event in the detector, the high energy photons produced from RMC must be produce to a high energy electron.
Asymmetric pair production from this photon is one such process, although producing the positron at rest is highly suppressed.
In addition, around 1~MeV is consumed my the mass of the electron-positron pair.
Compton scattering provides another mechanism by which the high-energy photon can convert to a high-energy electron.
In the limit where the photon is reflected directly back, the resultant electron is around $M_e/2$ more energy than the incoming photon.
As such it is Compton scattering which is more of a concern for COMET.

Finally, given the maximum photon energy is below the momentum threshold of \VarMomThreshold, the energy needs to be mis-reconstructed by around 2.4~MeV.
If the final resolution function were Gaussian with a 200~keV/c width (at signal energies), then mis-reconstruction by such an amount would be an 11~$\sigma$ event, \ie $P(p_\textrm{recon}-p_\textrm{true}>\SI{2.4}{MeV/c})=\num{1.9e-28}$.
However, the resolution function is not likely to be a pure Gaussian.
On-going studies for reconstruction with the  \phaseI StrECAL currently suggest that $P(p_\textrm{recon}-p_\textrm{true}>\SI{2.4}{MeV/c})=\num{7.5e-3}$~\cite{YFujiiStrECALRecon}.
Although this is considerably larger than the pure Gaussian, this is based on the most preliminary results of reconstruction algorithms.
If need be, cuts on fit quality can be improved over the current \phaseI values; the sensitivity estimate presented here should be robust against this since it includes the CDR estimate for the signal efficiency of such a cut.

\subsection{Calculation and Simulation of RMC}
Conversion of the RMC photons can take place in any of the material around the target, such as the beam blocker, solenoids, or cryostat.
To estimate the acceptance of the electrons produced from this conversion a simulation was performed where RMC photons were input at the stopping target, using the realistic muon stopping distribution obtained previously.
Geant4 implements the process of photo conversion via both of the above methods.

To build a realistic end-point spectrum, the same recipe as used in the \phaseI TDR was applied~\cite{TDR2016}.
The spectrum shape near the end-point is modelled by the equation~\cite{CHRISTILLIN1980331}:
\begin{equation}
	\eqlabel{bg:rmc:spect}
	\Gamma(\textrm{RMC})\propto(1-2x+2x^2)(x)(1-x)^2,
\end{equation}
where $x=E_\gamma/\max(E_e^\textrm{RMC})$.
The largest observed branching ratio for \ac{RMC} -- \num{1.83e-5} compared to ordinary muon capture --  is used to set the normalisation.
The relative rate of \ac{RMC} resulting in photons with energies above 90~MeV is, based on the spectrum in equation~\eq{bg:rmc:spect}, \num{7.7e-3} of the experimentally observed rate.
\FigRMCSimResults

Given the total number of muon stops during \phaseII, the probability of ordinary muon capture, and the relative rates for \ac{RMC}, one expects some \num{1.2e11} photons to be produced in the target with energies above 95~MeV.
Since this is an intrinsic background, the lifetime of this process will be the same as for signal events. 
Assuming, therefore, the same timing window acceptance, and applying the same reconstruction and TDAQ efficiencies as for signal, this number is reduced to \num{3.3e10}.
If the resolution function were truly a 200~keV/c Gaussian, then this would be no issue, regardless of the geometric acceptance or probability of Compton scattering.
If, however, the current \phaseI high-energy reconstruction tail were present, we would expect some \num{2.4e8} events to be considered dangerous if they were all accepted.

To check the geometric acceptance of the beamline, some \num{6e7} RMC events were generated in the stopping target, with initial photon energies greater than 90~MeV and distributed according to the spectrum in equation~\eq{bg:rmc:spect}.
\Fig{bg:rmc:simulation} shows the momentum and rate at which these were detected.
Based on this, the fraction of events reaching the detector with momentum larger than 98~MeV/c was \num{6.2e-7}, whilst above 100~MeV/c only \num{3.3e-8} electrons per \ac{RMC}$|_{p>90}$ event were detected.

As a result, if the current \phaseI resolution were applied, we would expect around 8 background events during the entire run.
However, since the resolution function at this stage is so poorly known, it seems to premature to define a value.
Instead, the predicted RMC rate provides a constraint on the high-energy tail of the resolution function: to do better than 0.1 background events during \phaseII from RMC, fewer than 1 in \num{1e4} high-energy electrons can be reconstructed with a momentum more than 2.4~MeV/c larger than the true value.

\subsection{Aluminium-26 and \ac{RMC}}
Based on the above energy calculation, the end-point for \ac{RMC} against ${}^{26}$Al (to ${}^{26}$Mg with no other particles emitted) would be 108.5~MeV.
Clearly such photons would be extremely dangerous to COMET if they are produced.

Aluminium-26 comes in two isomers, one with a half-life of around 6 seconds~\cite{PhysRevLett.106.032501}, the other lasting around 700 thousand years~\cite{AUDI20033}.
Since Al-26 is unstable its abundance in natural aluminium is low.
However, it can be produced by various methods, such as proton and deuteron bombardment of magnesium and sodium, or photoneutron emission of the aluminium-27 isotope~\cite{THOMPSON1965486}.
With such production mechanisms, it is likely that alumininium-26 will be produced in the COMET stopping target, via the interaction of daughter nuclei of muon capture (which are typically magnesium and sodium)
with protons, deuterons, gammas, and neutrons coming from either the beam or as products of muon capture.
The exact rate of Al-26 production, however, is a complicated value to estimate and one that unfortunately cannot be estimated here.

One can, however, set an acceptable rate of production if the induced background event rate is to be kept at the level of 0.1 events.
Based on the previous simulation of Al-27 \ac{RMC}, the probability of an electron being detected within 5~MeV of the \ac{RMC} end-point is \num{5.6e-18} per nuclear muon capture.
With \VarTotalMuStops muon stops during \phaseII, and assuming that the branching ratios for both ordinary and radiative muon capture are the same for Al-26 and Al-27 (61\%), then the
concentration of Al-26 in the stopping target must be less than 1\% (by number density) on average during the entire \phaseII run.
The branching ratio for radiative muon capture is, in reality, likely to be slightly more than in Al-27, based on the fact that the neutron excess of a given isotope seems a better indicator of the branching ratio than atomic number, and that the two are anti-correlated~\cite{RevModPhys.76.31}.

Clearly though, there is more work to be done on this, including a better understanding of \ac{RMC} events coming from Al-26, as well as understanding the rate of Al-26 production from muon beams.
Data from the \alcap experiment might be able to help with this, however, since the production rate could depend a lot on the exact beam conditions, measuring this directly should be an important goal of \phaseI.

Finally, if this does produce a sizeable background contribution, one can imagine several techniques to mitigate or reduce the challenge this poses.
Provided one can measure the concentration of Al-26 in the stopping target at the end of the run, and ideally at various stages whilst running, then the number of backgrounds can be predicted and possibly subtracted.
Additionally, it could be possible to remove the stopping target and replace it with a fresh one such that the Al-26 concentration never rises beyond an unsafe level.

\section{Radiative Pion Capture (\acs{RPC})}
\sectlabel{bg:rpc}
\subsection{Pion Stopping Rate}
Negative pions risk producing background events since photons emitted during their capture can reach above the \mueconv signal given the large pion mass.
As for the photons of \ac{RMC}, the \ac{RPC} photons can be converted via Compton scattering or pair production to signal-like electrons.

However, since the pion interacts via the strong force negative pions capture almost immediately in the nucleus, on the order of picoseconds~\cite{Engelhardt:1975ct}.
The timing of backgrounds caused from pion capture are therefore determined predominantly by the time when the pion was produced.
If a background arises from pion capture and the pion was produced in the main muon pulse, then the pion or resultant background electron must have been significantly delayed.
Delayed \ac{RPC} backgrounds are therefore suppressed by the delayed-time detector window.
If however a background arises because the pion was produced outside of the main proton pulse, due to late-arriving protons, then this background is considered prompt.
These \ac{RPC} background events are, therefore, suppressed by the extinction factor.

\FigRPCData
\subsection{Photons from Radiative Pion Capture (\acs{RPC})}
In much the same way as \ac{RMC}, when a pion is captured in a nucleus there is a chance that it will produce a prompt, hard photon.
\Fig{bg:rpc:spectra} shows the observed spectrum of photons coming from RPC for magnesium and calcium.
The relative rate for \ac{RPC} compared to ordinary pion capture is discussed in Amaro \etal~\cite{Amaro:1997ed}.
For the three isotopes studied there --- carbon, oxygen, and calcium --- the measured and predicted branching ratios are all within 1.19\% and 2.27\%, so we take here the branching ratio for RPC on aluminium to be the largest of these (likely an overestimate) of 2.27\%.

\section{Anti-protons in the Beam}
\sectlabel{bg:antiprotons}
Antiprotons can be produced when the primary 8~GeV proton beam interacts with the production target, creating a proton-antiproton pair:
\begin{equation}
p + N(A,Z) \rightarrow p + N^*(A,Z) + p+\bar{p}
\end{equation}
Given their relatively large mass, antiprotons travel much more slowly than other products of the same momentum which results in a smearing of the beam's time-structure for antiprotons and their secondaries.
The pulsed beam and time-gated detector window are therefore not effective at suppressing the induced backgrounds.

\subsection{Antiproton Production Rate and Spectrum}
There is really very little literature on the production of antiprotons from a tungsten target for a range of angles.
Accordingly most hadron models are particularly under-constrained when it comes to antiproton production.
The QGSP_BERT_HP model used as the basis for SimG4 is, in fact, completely unable to produce antiprotons.

In the COMET TDR....

Although tungsten targets seem not to have been studied at all at the relevant angles and proton energies, a set of papers \cite{Boyarinov:1994tp,Kiselev:2012sj} do exist covering antiproton production up to 2 radians for a tantulum target (which is adjacent to tungsten on the periodic table) and with 10 GeV protons.
Between them these measurements provide the invariant triple-differential cross section as a function of antiproton momentum for production angles of 10, 59, 97 and 119\degree, defined as:
\begin{equation}
	F(p,\theta,\phi)=E \frac{d^3\sigma}{dp^3}=E\frac{d^3\sigma(p,\theta,\phi)}{p^2dpd\Omega}
\end{equation}
where $E$ and $p$ the antiproton energy and momentum.  The earlier Boyarinov paper actually reports $f=F/A$, where $A$ is the relative atomic mass of the nucleus.
\Fig{bg:antiprotons:cross-sections} shows the data from these papers \CHECK{Add figure of cross sections from these papers}.
From the measured cross sections, it is clear that as you move to larger angles, the spectrum becomes considerably softer whilst the overall rate falls quickly, in much the same way as for pion production.
To convert the differential invariant cross sections given in the literature into a differential production rate per \ac{POT}, $d^3R(\theta)/dpd\Omega$, the following formula is used:
\begin{align}
	\frac{d^3R(p,\theta,\phi)}{dp^3}&=\frac{F(p,\theta,\phi)}{E}\frac{\rho N_A l}{m_N}
\end{align}
where $\rho$ is the mass density of the target, 19.25~g/cm$^3$ for Tungsten, $m_N$ the atomic mass, 183.86~g/mol for tungsten, $l$ the length of the target, and $N_A$ is Avodadro's number.

\FigAntiprotonEndpoint
To build the limited number of data-points from this paper into a complete but conservative spectrum, empirical fits to the data were performed after adding two data points for the minimum and maximum momentum.
The minimum momentum only added the constraint that at zero momentum the cross section also be zero.
On the other hand, to calculate the maximum momentum the kinematic end-point was found by considering the entire nucleus and two out-going protons to recoil directly against the antiproton.
The value of the end-point kinetic energy and longitudinal and transverse momenta for tungsten and carbon are shown in \fig{bg:antiprotons:end-point} using the formulae derived in appendix~\sect{appendix:antiprotonEndpoint}.
This end-point will be a highly conservative estimate, since in reality not all the nucleus will recoil coherently;  the de Broglie wavelength for a proton with 8~GeV kinetic energy is about 0.15~fm, compared to the 7~fm or so of a tungsten nucleus%
\footnote{Antiproton production from protons in this energy regime was historically referred to as sub-threshold production, since it is below the threshold for single nucleon interactions.
  The older literature also refers to a parameter called the `cumulative number' which was related to the number of nucleons that must be involved to produce secondary hadrons (\eg antiprotons or pions) with such out-going energies, given the incoming proton energy.  
These sub-threshold secondary particles were themselves sometimes called cumulative particles.}.
Additionally, achieving this end-point configuration would be highly phase-space suppressed.

\FigAntiprotonFits
With the addition of these two end-points, to interpolate and extrapolate the data, a polynomial of order 4 to 6 (depending on the number of available data points) was used to fit up to the final measured point.
For the high-momentum tails of each spectrum two fits were tried: a straight line fit between the last measured value and the kinematic end-point described above; and an exponential fitted to the kinematic end-point and last two data points.  
\Fig{bg:antiprotons:fits} shows the results of this fitting procedure, where it can be seen that a low momentum peak is visible and a high momentum tail well described.
Whilst these spectra are likely a poor representation of the true production spectrum, they serve as useful upper bounds which can be used as inputs for the antiproton background rate estimation.

\subsection{Simulating Antiprotons}
\TabAntiprotonRegions
To study the resultant backgrounds, antiprotons were generated uniformly in the production target.
Four separate simulations were run, corresponding to the four angular regions provided by the data, as shown in \tab{bg:antiprotons:regions}.
For each simulation, antiprotons were generated isotropically within a cone parallel to the incoming proton beam, with minimum and maximum values of theta defined by the angular region being studied.
The momentum distribution used the fitting procedure described above for the angle at the lower edge of the region (and for the region from 0 -- 59\degree, the fit to the 10\degree data was used).

Given the strong angular dependence visible from the measurements, events were reweighted during analysis based on the angle between the initial antiproton direction and the proton beam.
The combined procedure of generating isotropically with a momentum distribution based on the fit to the data, then reweighting based on the angle, amounts to the following factorisation of the measured differential cross section:
%It is clear from the four measured directions that the cross section for anti-proton prodcution has a strong dependence on the angle of production.
%To extrapolate this dependence to angles other than those measured, the differential cross section was factorised into a momentum and angular dependence:
\begin{equation}
	F(p,\theta,\phi)=\left(\frac{E}{p^2}\frac{dP(p)}{dp}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d\Phi(\theta)}{d\theta}\right)
\end{equation}
\FigAntiprotonAngularDependence
For a given value of $\theta$, the momentum distribution, $dP/dp$, is given by the fit to the cross-section data measured at the value of $\theta$ that is closest but smaller than the generated value.
When these distributions are used to generate particles they are essentially normalised so their integral is unity.
%For a given value of $\theta$ the momentum distribution $dP/dp$ is chosen to match the first spectrum measured at a larger value of $\theta$.
%This keeps the model conservative since the true momentum spectrum should soften as one moves to higher angles which this will not do.
$d\Phi/d\theta$ is then used to vary the overall normalisation as a function of theta.
Boyarinov et al. state~\cite{Boyarinov:1994tp} that the angular dependence will take the form:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\Phi(\theta)}{d\theta}=\alpha e^{\beta\cos\theta}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants.
\Fig{bg:antiprotons:angular} shows how the integrals of the fitted spectra vary with the measured angles, and it can be seen that with the extrapolated tails included, the fits appear more as a quadratic function.
Nevertheless, the 

This factorisation injects the assumption that the momentum distribution at a given angle is independent of the angle.
Whilst this should not be the case for a realistic spectrum, to produce limits on the background rate it is a valid assumption.
The $\phi$ dependence of $\Phi(\theta,\phi)$ is assumed constant.  

\subsection{Antiproton Transmission}
\Fig{bg:antiprotons:transmission} shows how antiprotons are transmitted along the beamline.
Material at the join between the production target capture region and the first bent muon transport solenoid designed to keep the vacuum seal and cryogenic conditions is also acting to remove antiprotons.
\Fig{bg:antiprotons:ap-timing-tor1-entrance} shows the timing of antiprotons reaching the entrance of the bent muon transport solenoid.

Based on these simulations, the probability that an antiproton will enter the bent muon transport solenoid is well less than XXXX per POT.
