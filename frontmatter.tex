%Sir Isaac Newton is supposed to have said, ``if I have seen further than others it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.''  
%But just how tall were these giants, and what did they eat?  
%How did Sir Isaac get on their shoulders and where have they all gone to?
%Like many problems in physics, these are just some of the questions we still do not know.
%
%But if this PhD has taught me anything (which I shall leave up to my examiners to decide), it is that doing science is considerably easier when working with figurative giants.
%Perhaps, in the end, that is what Newton meant?  
%
%The first of these figurative giants has to be my family.
%Mum and dad, thank you for everything that you have given me, from the food, housing, clothes and the chauffering, to the curiosity and confidence to pursue what I love.
%I can honestly say that without either one of you, I would be less existent.
%Will and Sophie, Chris, and Marie-Claire, you are all much more recent additions to my life, but it is such a richer experience for it; I love you all.
%And then to Dan, my older younger brother.
%
%To Lorena, my brilliant fianc\'{e}e:
%it may not be her first language, but that has certainly not stopped her correcting my english---if there are any dodgy commas in this thesis, all blame rests squarely on her shoulders.
%You might have caused me to spend more time in Uberlandia, Berlin, and Amsterdam, working remotely, but then I did get to spend more time in Uberlandia, Berlin, and Amsterdam, working remotely.
%Thank you for all your patience, your help, your caring; I suppose I will have to find another excuse beyond thesis stress now!

%This PhD has been one of opportunities and variety and, had it been focussed on an experiment other than COMET, I believe that would not have been the case.
%I owe therefore a deep gratitude to my collaborators on the experiment, who have endured my pedantry on reviews of software merge-requests, extended 
%To my collaborators on COMET, it has been an absolute honour and a pleasure to work with you all.
%You have given me so many opportunities to learn and grow.  
%Working with collaborators from around the world has been an incredible experience in isteld.
%%I have tried my best to sieze on all the opportunities you have provided me to learn and grow and mess up.
%Specifically to Yoshi Kuno and Satoshi Mihara, thank you both for supporting me during my time(s) in Japan:
%I do not think there are many PhD students who can say they have been driven to the airport by the spokesperson of the experiment!
%To my colleagues at Imperial, in particular, thank you for putting up with my daft ideas and silly questions.
%To Yoshi Uchida, my supervisor, thank you for drilling home the benefits of correct latex
%The other students and the staff that I have the privilidge of being around at 
%Imperial College London has provided extremely fertile ground for me, 
%
%
%To my Mum and Dad, you have been 
%Unfortunately, there were few giants around for me to stand on, although I have had the gigantic support of friends, family, and colleagues, without whom I could not have managed this thesis.
