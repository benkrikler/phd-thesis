Conservation of Lepton Flavour in the Standard Model (SM) requires that neutrino emission accompanies muon decay.
The COMET experiment is one experiment looking for Charged Lepton Flavour Violation.
It searches for COherent Muon to Electron Transitions, where a muon converts to a 105~MeV electron in the presence of an atomic nucleus, without neutrino emission.
The current limit on this process is \senseSindrum at 90\% C.L., which COMET intends to improve by four orders of magnitude.

To realise such an improvement COMET will use several novel techniques to produce a very intense, low-energy muon
beam, with very high signal acceptance and strong background suppression.
Given the challenge this presents, COMET will run in a staged approach.
\phaseI is currently under construction with first data-taking due in JFY 2018, and the goal of measuring \mueconv with a \ac{ses} of \sensePI.
\phaseII should follow at the start of the next decade and achieve a \ac{ses} of \sensePII.

This thesis provides an overview of CLFV, \mueconv, and the COMET experiment itself.
It sets out the software and simulation that has been developed to help understand and analyse the experiment,
and then uses this to perform a comprehensive optimisation of the \phaseII set-up, providing a new baseline configuration.
The expected performance of this baseline is assessed, with studies on the signal sensitivity
 demonstrating that an SES of \VarPredictedSES can be achieved in \VarRunTime~s of beam.
Background rates are then estimated and, although subject to large uncertainties, predict \VarTotalBgPhasII background events can be expected during \phaseII.
Suggestions for future performance studies and experiment improvements are also discussed, with a possible improvement in the SES of a factor of 2.5 likely achievable.

%This PhD has been one of opportunities and variety and, had it been focussed on an experiment other than COMET, I believe that would not have been the case.
